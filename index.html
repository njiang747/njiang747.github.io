                    <p>My name is Nick Jiang, and I'm currently working as a software engineer at Nuro. There, I develop simulation software to aid our progress in creating an autonomous robot for local goods delivery. I recently graduated from Princeton University with a B.S.E. degree in Computer Science. Previously, I interned on the Bing Agility team at Microsoft in Bellevue, WA where I developed a predictive cloud resource auto-scaler. Prior to that, I interned on the Intellectual Property team at Stroz Friedberg in Boston, MA where I worked on code comparison software for use in code theft cases.</p>
                    <p>I love to develop and create &ndash; new applications, tools, whatever! The feeling of taking a project from an idea all the way through its realization is what keeps me coding. Whether attempting to recreate Pok√©mon in my first year of Java Programming in high school or staying up for nearly 36 hours straight developing a sketch-based search engine for a hackathon, I always seem to lose track of the hours that go by while engrossed in an exciting project.</p>
                    <p>Offline, I enjoy eating copious amounts of Asian food, playing tennis, ping pong, and piano as well as cooking and taking care of my wide array of succulents.</p>

                        <p>Tyle is a project I developed with two friends to explore new ways of interacting with and controlling our digital experience. It revolves around the use of physical tiles, simple icons made of paper and cardboard, to control applications through a vision system that tracks the tiles within its field of vision and triggers corresponding actions on the computer. Tyle was developed for HackPrinceton Spring 2018 where it placed in the Top 10 Hacks and received prizes for Audience Choice and Best Design.</p>
                        <p>Within this project, I developed the vision system to identify and track the tiles across a variety of lighting conditions, using k-means clustering to uniquely associate color combinations with each tile.

                        <p>TranslatAR brings subtitles to life. Using Microsoft's Cognitive Services API combined with our makeshift augmented reality headset (an iPhone, Google Cardboard, and webcam hastily rubber-banded together), we project translated subtitles for multiple languages simultaneously in front of the wearer. Two friends and I created this project for HackPrinceton Fall 2017 where it placed in the Top 10 Hacks and received the Audience Choice and Best Hack for Social Good prizes.</p>
                        <p>I particularly focused on allowing our application to process multiple input audio sources in different languages simultaneously through multithreading. Here's our <a href="https://devpost.com/software/translatar">Devpost</a> for more information and a demo video!</p>

                        <p>Papyr is an application that transforms a standard webcam and a simple piece of white paper into a trackpad with no need for touch or pressure sensors. I worked with two friends to develop it for HackPrinceton Spring 2017 where it placed in the Top 10 Hacks and received the Audience Choice prize.</p>
                        <p>In this project, we designed and implemented original computer vision algorithms to convert the live video stream of a hand moving on a piece of paper into mouse movements, clicking, and scrolling. I focused on converting the frame images into on-screen coordinates while maintaining stability under variable lighting conditions and extraneous movement.

                        <p>SketchIt is an image search engine written in Python that allows you to simply draw a sketch and find pictures that match your query. I developed it alongside two of my friends for HackPrinceton Fall 2016 where it won the 2nd place overall, Most Technically Challenging Hack, and Best Use of Microsoft Technology prizes.</p>
                        <p>Within the team, I implemented the core scoring engine that evaluates sketch-to-picture matchings using edge and pixel level data. In addition to these image-to-image comparisons, we also incorporated Microsoft Cognitive Services' Vision API to allow for further refining of results through textual tags.

                        <p>Pic 2 Paint is a web application I developed for the open final assignment in my Computer Graphics class. The inspiration for this project came from expressionistic paintings, in particular Vincent Van Gogh's <span id="starry_text" class="popup_trigger">Starry Night</span>. </p>
                        <p>The tool renders pictures in a variety of painted styles and indeed was used to create the background for this website. It also creates animated GIFs to visualize the process of painting the digital canvas in multiple layers of strokes.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to try out the tool for yourself <a href="Painting426">here</a>, check out the <a href="Painting426/gallery.html">gallery</a> of examples, or read my <a href="resources/media/pic2paint.pdf">writeup</a> of the process and algorithm.</p>

                        <p>Kweri is an in-class, realtime anonymous question platform that enables professors to tailor instruction and clarification specifically toward the students in the classroom.</p>
                        <p>Built upon an HTML and CSS front-end, JavaScript app logic, and MongoDB database, it was developed over 6 weeks by four friends and me as the culminating development project for our Advanced Programming Techniques class in the spring of 2016.</p>
                        <p>I focused primarily on the app logic and backend database design, personally implementing much of the question page functionality, page navigation, and communication between the database and application. You are welcome to check out the app <a href="https://kweri.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, although it requires a Princeton account to access the questions page.</p>

                        <p>Free Space is an application built to allow students to check for open spots in study carrels, music practice rooms, and more around campus. I developed it in a team of three for HackPrinceton Spring 2016 where it won the award for Best Internet of Things Hack.</p>
                        <p>Combining Electric Imp hardware with a Meteor web application, Free Space uses light and sound sensors to determine space occupancy and provides the information in an intuitive visual form available online. The entire model is built to be flexible, with sensor integration made modular, allowing for simple plug-and-chug switching between different types of sensors.</p>
                        <p>Within the application, I concentrated on the application logic, database integration, and UI, providing the application with a responsive feel in conveying realtime information.
